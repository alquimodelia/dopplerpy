# DopplerPy: Shape-Shifting Python Module Template

Welcome to DopplerPy, where the magic of shape-shifting meets the world of Python module development. Inspired by the fantastical Dopplers from the realm of fantasy and science fiction, this Python module template empowers you to create projects with adaptability and transformation at their core. Just as Dopplers can seamlessly change their appearance, DopplerPy allows your Python code to shift and adapt to various project needs.

## Requirements

Before embarking on your journey with DopplerPy, you must ensure you have the following requirements in place:

**1. Python:**

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or, if you already have Python installed, you can check the version using the following command:

**2. Cookiecutter:**

```bash
pip install cookiecutter jinja2_time virtualenvwrapper
```

## Usage

Using DopplerPy is as enchanting as it sounds. To start your journey with DopplerPy, follow these steps:

1. Invoke the magic of shape-shifting by running the following command to generate a new Python module project folder:

```bash
cookiecutter git@github.com:alquimodelia/dopplerpy.git
```
2. As you embark on your project quest, answer a series of questions to customize your project's specifics. Feel free to leave answers blank to accept the defaults if you prefer.

3. For the seasoned sorcerers of Cookiecutter, consider crafting your own 'personal defaults' through a local ~/.cookiecutter.rc file, adding a touch of your unique magic to the process.

## Structure

Your adventure with DopplerPy will yield a project structure like no other:

- **tests**: The realm of unit tests, where you validate your creations.
- **tests/data**: Treasures of data for testing, ready for your magical experimentation.
- **docs**: The library of Sphinx, where you can inscribe the spells and secrets of your project.
- **{{module_name}}**: The heart of your creation, where your Python code takes form, adapts, and thrives in a world of possibilities.

With DopplerPy, you'll have the power to shape-shift your Python projects into versatile, ever-adapting creations, inspired by the mysteries and wonders of fantasy and science fiction.
